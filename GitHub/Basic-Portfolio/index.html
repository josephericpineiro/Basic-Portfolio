			<p>
			I was born and raised in a town called Grandview Heights, just a few miles from downtown Columbus, OH. I majored in Philosophy at The Ohio State University and moved here to Austin four months after graduation. I've lived here for almost two years. 
			<br>
			I used to do crossfit and enjoy all types of sportsings, from running, to frisbee, to lifting, to ping-pong. Not a huge fan of golf though.
